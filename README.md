Deprecated: I can't keep this up to date...and also this exists now: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app

I like this basic setup for react+mui apps.

After cloning this repo, run
```
npx npm-check-updates -u
```
to update package.json to the latest versions.
